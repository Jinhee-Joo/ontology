"Middle East Consensus Statement on the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Management of Cow’s Milk Protein Allergy | Middle East Consensus Statement on the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Management of Cow’s Milk Protein Allergy","Presented are guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) which is the most common food allergy in infants. It manifests through a variety of symptoms that place a burden on both the infant and their caregivers. The guidelines were formulated by evaluation of existing evidence-based guidelines, literature evidence and expert clinical experience. The guidelines set out practical recommendations and include algorithms for the prevention and treatment of CMPA. For infants at risk of allergy, appropriate prevention diets are suggested. Breastfeeding is the best method for prevention; however, a partially hydrolyzed formula should be used in infants unable to be breastfed. In infants with suspected CMPA, guidelines are presented for the appropriate diag-nostic workup and subsequent appropriate elimination diet for treatment. Exclusive breastfeeding and maternal diet-ary allergen avoidance are the best treatment. In infants not exclusively breastfed, an extensively hydrolyzed formula should be used with amino acid formula recommended if the symptoms are life-threatening or do not resolve after extensively hydrolyzed formula. Adherence to these guidelines should assist healthcare practitioners in optimizing their approach to the management of CMPA and decrease the burden on infants and their caregivers.

Is This Symptom Even a Food Allergy?: Clinical Types of Food Protein-induced Enterocolitis Syndrome | Is This Symptom Even a Food Allergy?: Clinical Types of Food Protein-induced Enterocolitis Syndrome,"Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is an under-recognized non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy. The diagnosis of FPIES is based on clinical history, sequential symptoms and the timing, after excluding other possible causes. It is definitively diagnosed by an oral food challenge test. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of FPIES is frequently delayed because of non-specific symptoms and insufficient definitive diagnostic biomarkers. FPIES is not well recognized by clinicians; the affected infants are often mismanaged as having viral gastroenteritis, food poisoning, sepsis, or a surgical disease. Familiarity with the clinical features of FPIES and awareness of the indexes of suspicion for FPIES are important to diagnose FPIES. Understanding the recently defined clinical terms and types of FPIES is mandatory to suspect and correctly diagnose FPIES. The aim of this review is to provide a case-driven presentation as a guide of how to recognize the clinical features of FPIES to improve diagnosis and management of patients with FPIES.

Clostridium difficile in Children: To Treat or Not to Treat? | Clostridium difficile in Children: To Treat or Not to Treat?,"Clostridium difficile infection has been increasing since 2000 in children and in adults. Frequent antibiotics use, co-morbidity, and the development of hypervirulent strains have increased the risk of infection. Despite the high carriage rates of C. difficile, infants rarely develop clinical infection. Discontinuing antibiotics and supportive management usually leads to resolution of disease. Antibiotics use should be stratified depending on the patient’s age and severity of the disease. Clostridium difficile infection has been increasing since 2000 in children and in adults.

Fundoplication in Neonates and Infants with Primary Gastroesophageal Reflux | Fundoplication in Neonates and Infants with Primary Gastroesophageal Reflux,"Purpose: Gastroesophageal reflux in infant is a physiological process. However, surgery is performed in high risk infants with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) when medical management fails. This study focuses on efficacy and safety of Nissen fundoplication for GERD in infants under age 12 months.
Methods: This study was a retrospective case analysis of 11 neonates and infants under 12 months of age who underwent Nissen fundoplication following a failure of medical treatment between June 2010 and June 2013 at Pusan National University Children’s Hospital. The records were reviewed to determine the effect of fundoplication on symptoms and post-operative complications.
Results: A total of 11 infants consist of four males and seven females. Mean birth weight was 2,305.5±558.6 g (1,390-3,130 g). They had some underlying disease, which are not related with GERD such as congenital heart disease (54.5%), prematurity (45.5%), neurologic disease (18.2%), respiratory disease (18.2%), and other gastrointestinal disease. Mean body weight at surgery was 3,803.6±1,864.9 g (1,938.7-5,668.5 g). Mean age at operation was 99.9±107.6 days (17-276 days). Duration from operation to full enteral feeding was 10.9 days. Symptoms related GERD disappeared in all patients including one who got reoperation. One infant died of congenital heart disease unrelated to surgery. There were no complications related to fundoplication.

Acalculous Diffuse Gallbladder Wall Thickening in Children | Acalculous Diffuse Gallbladder Wall Thickening in Children,"Purpose: Gallbladder (GB) wall thickening can be found in various conditions unrelated to intrinsic GB disease. We investigated the predisposing etiologies and the outcome of acalculous GB wall thickening in children.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 67 children with acalculous GB wall thickening who had visited our institute from June 2010 to June 2013. GB wall thickening was defined as a GB wall diameter ＞3.5 mm on abdominal ultrasound examination or computed tomography. Underlying diseases associated with GB wall thickening, treatment, and outcomes were studied.
Results: There were 36 boys and 31 girls (mean age, 8.5±4.8 years [range, 7 months-16 years]). Systemic infection in 24 patients (35.8%), acute hepatitis in 18 (26.9%), systemic disease in 11 (16.4%), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in 4 (6.0%), acute pancreatitis in 3 (4.5%), and specific liver disease in 3 (4.5%) predisposed patients to GB wall thickening. Systemic infections were caused by bacteria in 10 patients (41.7%), viruses in 5 patients (20.8%), and fungi in 2 patients (8.3%). Systemic diseases observed were systemic lupus erythematosus in 2, drug-induced hypersensitivity in 2, congestive heart failure in 2, renal disorder in 2. Sixty-one patients (91.0%) received symptomatic treatments or treatment for underlying diseases. Five patients (7.5%) died from underlying diseases.
Cholecystectomy was performed in 3 patients during treatment of the underlying disease.
Conclusion: A wide range of extracholecystic conditions cause diffuse GB wall thickening that resolves spontaneously or with treatment of underlying diseases. Surgical treatments should be avoided if there are no definite clinical manifestations of cholecystitis.

Growth and Tolerance Assessment of a Lutein-fortified Infant Formula | Growth and Tolerance Assessment of a Lutein-fortified Infant Formula,"Purpose: To evaluate safety, gastrointestinal tolerance, and growth of a new experimental starter formula (NESF) fortified with lutein, prebiotics, probiotics, nucleotides and beta-carotene, fed to infants within the first months of life.
Methods: This was a non-randomized, open, uncontrolled study conducted from December 2010 to May 2011.
Twenty-three healthy infants aged 10 days to 2 months old were enrolled. Outcomes included gastrointestinal tolerance, physical growth and safety. Prior to the initiation of the trial, the Scientific Research Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences confirmed that the NESF met all safety and nutritional parameters.
Results: NESF was well tolerated. The majority of infants fed this formula passed semi-liquid, yellow or yellow-brown.
The mean stool frequency/day was 2.5±0.4 on study-day 14 and 1.8±0.5 on study-day 28. The mean daily weight gain was 30.9±3.8 grams and the mean length gain during the 28 days of follow up was 3.1±0.8 cm, corresponding to the average physical growth normally seen in the first months of life in Russian infants. Six children left the study: one refused to drink the formula, one left the study as parents changed residence; and one child’s parents have recalled their informed consent due to adverse event unrelated to the product. Three infants presented adverse events possibly related to the product (rash; colic and abdominal pain; constipation). Seventeen infants completed the trial.

Two Cases of Infantile Intra-abdominal Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor | Two Cases of Infantile Intra-abdominal Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is rare mesenchymal solid tumor that consists of proliferating myofibro-blasts with an inflammatory infiltrate background. It has a very low prevalence in infants and occurs mainly in children and young adults. IMT are mainly located in the thoracic cavity, but intra-abdominal lesions are rare. IMT can exhibit locally aggressive neoplastic processes and metastases similar to malignancies, so, have clinical importance. Herein, we describe two infantile intra-abdominal IMT cases presenting with incidentally found palpable abdominal mass. A 4-month-old male infant had IMT at the ileal mesentery and a 5-month-old male infant had IMT at liver. Both cases were successfully treated by complete surgical resection without complication or recurrence. Considering the biological behavior of the intermediate type of neoplasm in IMT, we expect good survivals when achieving appro-priate surgical resection without adjuvant therapy in infantile intra-abdominal IMT.

Efficacy and Tolerance of a New Anti-Regurgitation Formula | Efficacy and Tolerance of a New Anti-Regurgitation Formula,"Purpose: Regurgitation is a common physiological phenomenon in infants. The aim of the present study was to eval-uate the efficacy of a new anti-regurgitation (AR) formula (Novalac), thickened with an innovative complex including fibres, on the daily number of regurgitations and to assess its impact on stool consistency and frequency.Methods: Infants younger than five months, presenting at least 5 regurgitations per day were recruited in this trial. The efficacy of the new formula on regurgitation (daily number and Vandenplas score), stool frequency and con-sistency were assessed at day 14 and 90. Growth data were recorded at each study visit.Results: Ninety babies (mean age 9.6±5.8 weeks) were included in the full analysis data set. The mean number of regurgitation episodes at inclusion was 7.3±3.4. In all infants, regurgitations improved after 2 weeks. The daily number of regurgitations decreased significantly (−6.3±3.3, p＜0.001) including in those previously fed a thickened formula (−6.2±3.0, p＜0.001). There was no significant change in stool consistency at day 14. After 3 months, 97.5% of infants had formed or soft stools. Growth was appropriate with a slight increase of weight-for-age z-score (from −0.5±1.0 to −0.1±0.9) and no change of weight-for length z-score (−0.1±1.1 to −0.1±−1.1).Conclusion: The new AR formula thickened with an innovative complex is very effective in reducing the daily number of regurgitations without having a negative impact on stools consistency.

The Association between Helicobacter pylori Infection and Body Weight among Children | The Association between Helicobacter pylori Infection and Body Weight among Children,"Purpose: We performed to reveal the association between the Helicobacter pylori infection and body weight among children.Methods: Out retrospective study included patients who underwent the H. pylori immunoglobulin G testing at Konyang University Hospital between March 2011 and June 2014. These patients were classified as seropositive (28 boys, 27 girls; mean age: 9.89±3.28 years) or seronegative (55 boys, 54 girls; mean age: 9.84±3.02 years). Next, we com-pared various characteristics between the seropositive and negative groups, as well as between obese children (body weight ≥90th percentile) and non-obese children (body weight ＜90th percentile). Furthermore, we compared the change in body weight after 2 months of treatment with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and omeprazole among the 55 seropositive children (14 treated children and 41 non-treated children).Results: There were no differences in the weights and laboratory data for the 55 seropositive children and 109 sero-negative children (weight; 40.96±18.11 kg vs. 36.85±13.72 kg, respectively; p=0.14). And, there was no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori infection among the 29 obese and 135 non-obese children (p=0.581). However, after 2 months of eradication, the 14 treated patients exhibited a significant weight gain (＋0.91±0.52 kg), compared to the 41 non-treated patients (−0.29±1.16 kg, p=0.025).Conclusion: Our findings present that obesity was not associated with the H. pylori infection, although H. pylori erad-ication led to significant increase in body weight.

At 1 year, 71% (5/7) of patients showed clinical response, and 43% (3/7) were under clinical remission. Among the total included patients, 5 patients (50%) showed clinical response at 1 year. Primary non-response to adalimumab was observed in 2 patients (20%), and secondary failure to adalimumab was observed in 3 patients (30%) during 1 year treatment with adalimumab. No serious adverse event had occurred during adalimumab treatment. Conclusion: Adalimumab was effective for 1 year without serious adverse events in half of pediatric-onset Crohn’sdisease patients who had failed treatment with infliximab.",Won Jae Song(Samsung Medical Center); Ben Kang(Samsung Medical Center); So Yoon Choi(Samsung Medical Center); 최연호(성균관대학교),소아과학,2016-06,영어
Nutrient Intakes and Hair Mineral Contents of Young Children | Nutrient Intakes and Hair Mineral Contents of Young Children,"Purpose: This study was performed to evaluate the dietary nutrient intake status and hair mineral content of Korean young children.Methods: Fifty-five children who visited Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were divided into three groups by age: infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. The 24-hour recall method was used to collect the food intake data of the subjects. Hair mineral analysis was conducted using a Mass Spectrometer. Serum iron, ferritin, and calcium were also measured. Results: The mean energy intakes of the subjects were 730.3 kcal, 994.3 kcal, and 1,482.9 kcal for each age group. The mean percentage of energy intake compared to recommendation was 101.4% and was not different by age group. Toddlers of 37.8% and preschoolers of 54.5% consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) of calcium. Infants of 28.6%, toddlers of 10.8% and preschoolers of 9.1% consumed less than the EAR of iron. In the case of zinc, copper, and selenium, only 0% to 5% of toddlers and none of the preschoolers consumed less than the EAR of those minerals. The hair calcium, iron and copper concentrations were lower in toddlers and pre-schoolers than those in infants. Serum calcium levels of preschoolers were significantly lower than those of infants, whereas serum iron and ferritin levels were not.Conclusion: Hair calcium, iron, and copper concentrations were significantly lower in toddlers and preschoolers than in infants. Insufficient dietary intake of calcium and iron seems to be related with decreased hair mineral contents in young children.

A Study on Dietary Habits and Lifestyle of Girls with PrecociousPuberty | A Study on Dietary Habits and Lifestyle of Girls with PrecociousPuberty,"Purpose: This study was conducted to analyze the change in the obesity index in girls receiving a gonado-tropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), based on treatment duration, and to aid in nutritional counseling by inves-tigating dietary habits and lifestyle.Methods: Anthropometric examinations were conducted on 62 girls treated with GnRHa from January 2010 through July 2014. Parents were asked to fill out questionnaires on patient dietary habits and lifestyle. Results: The group taking GnRHa for over 1 year had a higher rate of obesity increase than the group taking GnRHa for less than 1 year, but they had common habits related to obesity, which should be corrected. In addition, 69.2% of the normal weight group taking GnRHa for over 1 year gained weight, and needed more intensive programs, which include physical exercise and nutritional education. Although girls with precocious puberty showed a decrease in the intake of high-calorie foods with nutritional intervention regardless of treatment duration, they still had problems that needed improvement, such as shorter meals and lack of exercise. Conclusion: Girls with precocious puberty and their parents should emphasize maintenance of proper body weight, especially when treatment for over 1 year is anticipated. Consistent education in nutrition, ways to increase intensity and duration of physical activity, and the need to slow down mealtimes are important in managing obesity; doctors need to perform regular checkups and provide nutritional counseling.

Hepatitis C Viral Infection in Children: Updated Review | Hepatitis C Viral Infection in Children: Updated Review,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major medical challenge affecting around 200 million people worldwide. The main site of HCV replication is the hepatocytes of the liver. HCV is a positive enveloped RNA virus from the flaviviridae family. Six major HCV genotypes are implicated in the human infection. In developed countries the children are in-fected mainly through vertical transmission during deliveries, while in developing countries it is still due to horizontal transmission from adults. Minimal nonspecific and brief symptoms are initially found in approximately 15% of children. Acute and chronic HCV infection is diagnosed through the recognition of HCV RNA. The main objective for treatment of chronic HCV is to convert detected HCV viremia to below the detection limit. Children with chronic HCV infection are usually asymptomatic and rarely develop severe liver damage. Therefore, the benefits from current therapies, pegylated-Interferon plus ribavirin, must be weighed against their adverse effects. This combined treatment offers a 50-90% chance of clearing HCV infection according to several studies and on different HCV genotype. Recent direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs which are well established for adults have not yet been approved for children and young adults below 18 years. The most important field for the prevention of HCV infection in children would be the prevention of perinatal and parenteral transmission. There are areas of focus for new lines of research in pediatric HCV-related disease that can be addressed in the near future.

Updates on the Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori Infection in Children: What Are the Differences between Adults and Children? | Updates on the Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori Infection in Children: What Are the Differences between Adults and Children?,"Helicobacter pylori infection is acquired mainly during childhood and causes various diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and iron deficiency anemia. Although H. pyloriinfection in children differs from adults in many ways, this is often overlooked in clinical practice. Unlike adults, nodular gastritis may be a pathognomonic endoscopic finding of childhood H. pylori infection. Histopathological findings of gastric tissues are also different in children due to predominance of lymphocytes and plasma cells and the formation of gastric MALT. Although endoscopy is recommended for the initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection, several non-in-vasive diagnostic tests such as the urea breath test (UBT) and the H. pylori stool antigen test (HpSA) are available and well validated even in children. According to recent data, both the 13C-UBT and HpSA using enzyme-linked im-munosorbent assay are reliable non-invasive tests to determine H. pylori status after eradication therapy, although children younger than 6 years are known to have high false positives. When invasive or noninvasive tests are applied to children to detect H. pylori infection, it should be noted that there are differences between children and adults in diagnosing H. pylori infection.

The Challenges of Diagnosing and Following Wilson Disease in the Presence of Proteinuria | The Challenges of Diagnosing and Following Wilson Disease in the Presence of Proteinuria,"The coexistence of Wilson disease with Alport syndrome has not previously been reported. The diagnosis of Wilson disease and its ongoing monitoring is challenging when associated with an underlying renal disease such as Alport syndrome. Proteinuria can lead to low ceruloplasmin since it is among serum proteins inappropriately filtered by the damaged glomerulus, and can also lead to increased urinary loss of heavy metals such as zinc and copper. Elevated transaminases may be attributed to dyslipidemia or drug induced hepatotoxicity. The accurate diagnosis of Wilson disease is essential for targeted therapy and improved prognosis. We describe a patient with a diagnosis of Alport syndrome who has had chronic elevation of transaminases eventually diagnosed with Wilson disease based on liver histology and genetics.

How to Improve Eating Behaviour during Early Childhood | How to Improve Eating Behaviour during Early Childhood,"Eating behaviour disorder during early childhood is a common pediatric problem. Many terminologies have been used interchangeably to describe this condition, hindering implementation of therapy and confusing a common problem.

Changing Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori Infections in Korean Children with Recurrent Abdominal Pain | Changing Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori Infections in Korean Children with Recurrent Abdominal Pain,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the changing prevalence rate of Helicobacter pylori infection in children, of different age groups, with recurrent abdominal pain over a 10-year period. Methods: Children with recurrent abdominal pain who visited the pediatric outpatient clinic at university hospital were screened for H. pylori. Children were divided into 3 age categories of 4-5, 6-11, and 12-16 years. To study the changes in the annual prevalence rates of H. pylori infection, the study period was divided into 3 time periods: 2004-2007, 2008-2010, and 2011-2014. Urea breath test was performed for all children aged 4-16 years, with a cut-off value of 4.0‰ for children aged ≥6 years and 7‰ for children aged ＜6 years.Results: A total of 2,530 children (1,191 boys) with a mean age of 10.0±3.0 years (range, 4.0-16.9 years) were included in the study. The total prevalence of H. pylori infection was 7.4% (187/2,530). The prevalence rate of H. pylori infection in children with recurrent abdominal pain was 8.0% (70/873) in 2004-2007, 7.7% (51/666) in 2008-2010, and 6.7% (66/991) in the 2011-2014. Nevertheless, a significant difference was observed in the prevalence rate between chil-dren ＜12 years old and ≥12 years of age (p=0.018). Conclusion: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in Korean children with recurrent abdominal pain was 7.4%, showing no significant decrease in the last 11 years; however, the prevalence rate in children ＜12 years old was significantly lower than that in those ≥12 years old.

The Efficacy of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 in Addition to Standard Helicobacter pylori Eradication Treatment in Children | The Efficacy of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 in Addition to Standard Helicobacter pylori Eradication Treatment in Children,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 during Helicobacter pylori eradication in children. Methods: One hundred ninety-four H. pylori positive children were randomized in two groups. Therapy (omepra-zole+clarithromycin+amoxicillin or omeprazole+clarithromycin+metronidazole in case of penicillin allergy) was given to both groups during two weeks. In the treatment group (n: 102) S. boulardii was added to the triple therapy, while the control group (n: 92) only received triple therapy. The incidence, onset, duration and severity of diarrhea and com-pliance to the eradication treatment were compared. A 13C urea breath test was done 4 weeks after the end of eradication therapy in two groups of 21 patients aged 12 years and older to test the H. pylori eradication rate. Results: In the treatment group, diarrhea occurred in 12 cases (11.76%), starting after 6.25±1.24 days, lasting 3.17±1.08 days, and compliance to eradication treatment was 100%. In the control group, diarrhea occurred in 26 cases (28.26%), starting after 4.05±1.11 days, lasting 4.02±0.87 days, and in six cases eradication treatment was stopped prematurely (p＜0.05). The 13C urea breath test showed successful H. pylori eradication in 71.4% of the patients in the treatment and in 61.9 % in the control group (not significant). Conclusion: S. boulardii has a beneficial effect on the prevention and treatment of diarrhea during H. pylori eradication in children. Although S. boulardii did only slightly increase H. pylori eradication rate, compliance to eradication treat-ment was improved.

Clinical Characteristics of Celiac Disease and Dietary Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet among Saudi Children | Clinical Characteristics of Celiac Disease and Dietary Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet among Saudi Children,"Purpose: To describe the clinical characteristics of celiac disease (CD) among Saudi children and to determine the adherence rate to gluten free diet (GFD) and its determinant factors among them.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, in which all the families registered in the Saudi Celiac Patients Support Group were sent an online survey. Only families with children 18 years of age and younger with biopsy-con-firmed CD were included.Results: The median age of the 113 included children was 9.9 years, the median age at symptom onset was 5.5 years and the median age at diagnosis was 7 years, the median time between the presentation and the final diagnosis was 1 year. Sixty two of the involved children were females. Ninety two percent of the patients were symptomatic at the diagnosis while eight percent were asymptomatic. The commonest presenting symptoms included: chronic abdominal pain (59.3%), poor weight gain (54%), abdominal distention, gases, bloating (46.1%) and chronic diarrhea (41.6%). Sixty percent of the involved children were reported to be strictly adherent to GFD. Younger age at diagnosis and shorter duration since the diagnosis were associated with a better adherence rate. Conclusion: CD has similar clinical presentations among Saudi children compared to other parts of the ward; however, the adherence to GFD is relatively poor. Younger age at diagnosis and shorter duration since the diagnosis were associated with a better adherence rate.

Availability of Blood Urea Nitrogen/Creatinine Ratio in Gastrointestinal Bleeding with Melena in Children | Availability of Blood Urea Nitrogen/Creatinine Ratio in Gastrointestinal Bleeding with Melena in Children,"Purpose: The aims of our study were to evaluate the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr ratio) for dis-tinguishing between an upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and differentiating between the two most common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) presenting with melena in children.Methods: Retrospective data of patients with GIB presenting with melena were analyzed. The data from 60 cases were reviewed including demographics, laboratory findings, diagnostic modalities and results, treatments, and transfusions.Results: Among the 60 cases, UGIB and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) were found in 35 cases (58.3%) and 14 cases (23.3%), respectively. The two common causes of UGIB were varices (37.1%), and peptic ulcer dis-eases (PUD) (31.4%). The BUN/Cr ratio of 30 or greater was higher in UGIB than LGIB (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3-37.2). In UGIB, the BUN/Cr ratio of the varices group was higher than that of the PUD group (p=0.015). The OR for the BUN/Cr ratio appeared as 1.2 per unit increase in the varices group than the PUD group (95% CI, 1.03-1.3). There was no difference between the PUD group and Meckel’s diverticulum group.Conclusion: The BUN/Cr ratio was not uneven in differentiating UGIB from LGIB of children with melena in our study. This suggests that BUN/Cr ratio should be interpreted carefully.

Liver Transplantation for Metabolic Liver Disease: Experience at a Living Donor Dominant Liver Transplantation Center | Liver Transplantation for Metabolic Liver Disease: Experience at a Living Donor Dominant Liver Transplantation Center,"Purpose: Metabolic liver disease (MLD) often progresses to life-threatening conditions. This study intends to describe the outcomes of liver transplantation (LTx) for MLD at a living donor-dominant transplantation center where potentially heterozygous carrier grafts are employed. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 54 patients with MLD who underwent LTx between November 1995 and February 2012 at Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. The cumulative graft and patient survival rates were analyzed according to patient age, and living or deceased donor LTx. Recurrence of the original disease was also investigated.Results: The post-transplant cumulative patient survival rates at one, five, and 10 years were 90.7%, 87.5% and 87.5%, and the graft survival rates were 88.8%, 85.5%, and 85.5%, respectively. There were no differences in the patient survival rates according to the recipient age, human leukocyte antigen matching, and living or deceased donor LTx. There were also no differences in the patient survival rates between the MLD and the non-MLD groups for children. Recurrence of the original metabolic disease was not observed in any patient during the follow-up period.Conclusion: Our results suggest that the living donor-dominant transplantation program is well-tolerated in MLD with-out recurrence of the original MLD using all types of transplantation.

Achalasia Previously Diagnosed as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease by Relying on Esophageal Impedance-pH Monitoring: Use of High-Resolution Esophageal Manometry in Children | Achalasia Previously Diagnosed as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease by Relying on Esophageal Impedance-pH Monitoring: Use of High-Resolution Esophageal Manometry in Children,"Gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) is the most common esophageal disorder in children. Achalasia occurs less commonly but has similar symptoms to GERD. A nine-year old boy presented with vomiting, heartburn, and nocturnal cough. The esophageal impedance-pH monitor revealed nonacidic GERD (all-refluxate clearance percent time of 20.9%). His symptoms persisted despite medical treatment for GERD, and he was lost to follow up. Four years later, he presented with heartburn, solid-food dysphagia, daily post-prandial vomiting, and failure to thrive. Endoscopy showed a severely dilated esophagus with candidiasis. High-resolution manometry was performed, and he was diagnosed with classic achalasia (also known as type I). His symptoms resolved after two pneumatic dilatation procedures, and his weight and height began to catch up to his peers. Clinicians might consider using high-resolution manometry in children with atypical GERD even after evaluation with an impedance-pH monitor.

Nutritional State of Children in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK): Based on the DPRK Final Report ofthe National Nutrition Survey 2012 | Nutritional State of Children in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK): Based on the DPRK Final Report ofthe National Nutrition Survey 2012,"A nationwide nutrition survey began when the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) requested assistance from international relief organizations in 1997 due to flooding in 1995-1996, followed by the worsening food shortage peak in 1997. According to reported data for the 15 years since the active intervention and assistance from interna-tional societies, the malnutrition and mortality rates of children in the DPRK have improved. However, the prevalence of the stunting reported in the latest 2012 report is 27.9%, which is still a moderate−severe level, and worrisome in terms of international standards. In particular, the prevalence in Ryangangdo, which is regarded as the worst region in the DPRK, is 39.6%, which is a very high level of stunting. To alleviate such regional deviation will be a major task for future assistance. In addition, one cannot emphasize too highly the importance of early nutritional assistance for pregnant women and infants, considering that the recovery from stunted growth is low after two years of age, and the aftereffects would continue for the rest of their lives.

"High Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Norovirus Gastroenteritis in Infancy: A Single-Center, 1-Year Experience | High Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Norovirus Gastroenteritis in Infancy: A Single-Center, 1-Year Experience","Purpose: The etiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) has changed since the introduction of the rotavirus vaccination.
The aim of this study was to clarify which common pathogens, both bacterial and viral, are currently causing AGE in infants.
Methods: Infants with acute diarrhea were enrolled. We tested for 10 bacterial pathogens and five viral pathogens in stool specimens collected from infants with AGE. The clinical symptoms such as vomiting, mucoid or bloody diarrhea, dehydration, irritability, and poor oral intake were recorded, and laboratory data such as white blood cell count and C-reactive protein were collected. The clinical and laboratory data for the cases with bacterial pathogens and the cases with viral pathogens were compared.
Results: Of 41 total infants, 21 (51.2%) were positive for at least one pathogen. Seventeen cases (41.5%) were positive for bacterial pathogens and seven cases (17.1%) were positive for viral pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus (13 cases, 31.7%) and Clostridium perfringens (four cases, 9.8%) were common bacterial pathogens. Norovirus (five cases, 12.2%) was the most common viral pathogen.

To assess gender differences by analysing data collected within the Swiss IBD cohort study database since 2008, related to children with IBD, using the Montreal classification for a systematic approach.
Methods: Data on gender, age, anthropometrics, disease location at diagnosis, disease behaviour, and therapy of 196 patients, 105 with Crohn’s disease (CD) and 91 with ulcerative or indeterminate colitis (UC/IC) were retrieved and analysed.
Results: The crude gender ratio (male : female) of patients with CD diagnosed at ＜10 years of age was 2.57, the adjusted ratio was 2.42, and in patients with UC/IC it was 0.68 and 0.64 respectively. The non-adjusted gender ratio of patients diagnosed at ≥10 years was 1.58 for CD and 0.88 for UC/IC. Boys with UC/IC diagnosed ＜10 years of age had a longer diagnostic delay, and in girls diagnosed with UC/IC ＞10 years a more important use of azathioprine was observed. No other gender difference was found after analysis of age, disease location and behaviour at diagnosis, duration of disease, familial occurrence of IBD, prevalence of extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, and requirement for surgery.
Conclusion: CD in children ＜10 years affects predominantly boys with a sex ratio of 2.57; the impact of sex-hormones on the development of CD in pre-pubertal male patients should be investigated.

Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric Constipation in South Jordan | Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric Constipation in South Jordan,"Purpose: Constipation is a common pediatric problem worldwide. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of pediatric constipation in south Jordan according to gender and age group.
Methods: All patients with constipation managed at our pediatric gastroenterology service between September 2009 and December 2012 were included. Hospital charts were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, and final diagnosis were recorded. Data were analyzed according to gender and the following age groups: infants, pre-school, school age, and adolescents.
Results: During the study period, 126 patients were enrolled. The number (percentage) of patients according to age were the following infants: 43 (34.1%), pre-school: 55 (43.7%), school age: 25 (19.8%), and adolescents: 3 (2.4%).
Males made up 54.8% of the study population. There were no statistical gender differences in any age group. The most common symptom in all age groups was dry, hard stool. Infrequent defecation was found in almost one-half of the patients. Fecal incontinence was more common in school-aged children compared to pre-school-aged children and adolescents. Abdominal pain was seen in almost 40% of the constipated children. Abdominal pain was more prevalent in girls and older children. Fecal mass in the rectum was the most common physical finding, with constipated boys exhibiting higher rates. Functional constipation was the most common etiology.
Conclusion: Clinical characteristics of constipation in children vary according to age group and gender. Older children had less frequent bowel motions, a longer duration of symptoms, and a higher prevalence of long-standing constipation compilations (fecal incontinence and abdominal pain).

Infrequent defecation was found in almost one-half of the patients. Fecal incontinence was more common in school-aged children compared to pre-school-aged children and adolescents. Abdominal pain was seen in almost 40% of the constipated children. Abdominal pain was more prevalent in girls and older children. Fecal mass in the rectum was the most common physical finding, with constipated boys exhibiting higher rates. Functional constipation was the most common etiology.
Conclusion: Clinical characteristics of constipation in children vary according to age group and gender. Older children had less frequent bowel motions, a longer duration of symptoms, and a higher prevalence of long-standing constipation compilations (fecal incontinence and abdominal pain).",Eyad Altamimi(Mu`tah University),소아과학,2014-09,영어
Serum Liver Enzyme Pattern in Birth Asphyxia Associated Liver Injury | Serum Liver Enzyme Pattern in Birth Asphyxia Associated Liver Injury,"Purpose: To study temporal pattern of serum liver enzymes levels in newborns with hepatic injury associated with birth asphyxia (BA).
Methods: Singleton term newborns with BA and ≤72 hours of age admitted to neonatal intensive care unit were prospectively enrolled. Term newborns with physiological jaundice and without BA were studied as controls. Serum liver enzymes were measured at ＜24 hours, 24-72 hours, and at 6-12 days of age for cases and at 1-6 days of age for controls. BA was defined by 1 minute Apgar score ＜7 or delayed or absent cry with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. BA-associated liver injury was defined as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation beyond +2 standard deviation (ALT > +2 SD) above the mean of control subjects at any of the three time points.
Results: Sixty controls and 62 cases were enrolled. Thirty-five cases (56%) developed BA-associated liver injury (ALT＞81 IU/L). They had higher serum levels of ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase than the control infants, with peak at 24-72 hours. In controls, serum liver enzyme levels were significantly higher in appropriate- for-date (AFD) babies than small-for-date (SFD) babies. Serum enzyme pattern and extent of elevation were comparable between SFD and AFD babies. Degree of serum liver enzyme elevation had no relationship with severity of hypoxic encephalopathy.
Conclusion: Serum liver enzyme elevation is common in BA; it peaks at 24-72 hours followed by a sharp decline by 6-12 days of age. Pattern and extent of enzyme elevation are comparable between SFD and AFD babies.

Relationship between Anomalous Pancreaticobiliary Ductal Union and Pathologic Inflammation of Bile Duct in Choledochal Cyst | Relationship between Anomalous Pancreaticobiliary Ductal Union and Pathologic Inflammation of Bile Duct in Choledochal Cyst,"Purpose: Choledochal cyst is a cystic dilatation of common bile duct. Although the etiology is presently uncertain, anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union (APBDU) is thought to be a major etiology of choledochal cyst. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and anatomical characteristics and pathologies of patients diagnosed with chol-edochal cyst in a single institute for 25 years.Methods: A total of 113 patients, diagnosed with choledochal cyst and who received an operation in Severance Children’s Hospital from January 1988 to May 2013, were included. Medical records were reviewed, including clinical and demographic data, surgical procedures. Abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatog-raphy, and intraoperative cholangiography were used as diagnostic tools for evaluation and classification of chol-edochal cyst and the presence of anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union. Todani’s classification, and relationship between APBDU and surgical pathology.Results: Among 113 patients, 77 patients (68.1%) presented symptoms such as hepatitis, pancreatitis and/or cholecystitis. Eighty three patients (73.5%) had APBDU, and 94 patients (83.2%) showed inflammatory pathologic changes. APBDU, pathologic inflammation, and serological abnormalities such as hepatitis or pancreatitis showed a statistically significant correlation to one another.Conclusion: APBDU is thought to be one of the etiologic factors of choledochal cyst.

The Status of Dietary Supplements Intake in Korean Preschool Children: Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012 | The Status of Dietary Supplements Intake in Korean Preschool Children: Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012,"Purpose: The use of dietary supplements (DS) has increased in most nations. We investigated the amount of DS intake in the Korean population by analyzing a national survey, to support the preparation of a national institutional strategy regarding DS intake and marketing.
Methods: The data of the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (a year between 2010 and 2012) were investigated, analyzing the rate of DS intake, and the characteristics of the intake group and non-intake group in Korean preschool children.
Results: The intake rate of DS was 49.0-54.2% (1,313,874-1,491,240) and 19.6-30.3% (250,603-421,922) in children from 1 to 6 years old and in those less than 1 year, respectively, from 2010 to 2012. The highest intake rate was observed in the age group of five. The mean age was significantly higher in the DS intake group than in the non-intake group. Intake of essential nutrients, minerals, and vitamins were also higher in the DS intake group. The level of family income was significantly associated with the intake rate (p＜0.001). In children less than 1 year, probiotics accounted for the highest intake of DS.
Conclusion: Korean preschool children have high consumption of DS. Therefore, problems may arise from the waste of money purchasing unnecessary DS, and from the overuse of DS in preschoolers who do not require DS intake.
We hope these results can be used to produce an appropriate national institutional strategy regarding DS intake and marketing.

Helicobacter pylori Associated Lymphocytic Gastritis in a Child | Helicobacter pylori Associated Lymphocytic Gastritis in a Child,"Lymphocytic gastritis (LG) is a rare subtype of chronic gastritis. It is defined as dense proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) more than 25 lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells. The known major causes of LG are celiac disease and Helicobacter pylori infection. H. pylori associated LG (HpLG) has more enhanced cytotoxic and apoptotic tendencies than chronic H. pylori gastritis. A 12-year-old girl with postprandial epigastric pain was diagnosed HpLG on endoscopic biopsy. After the 1st eradication therapy, H. pylori bacilli were still found, and urea breathing test was positive. Although the endoscopic finding was partially improved, clinical symptoms and histologic finding were persisted. We could achieve the improvement of clinical symptoms and disappearance of IELs after the 2nd eradication. The discordant of histopathologic and endoscopic improvement occurred after the 1st eradication ther-apy of HpLG. Therefore the clinical and histopathologic evaluation should be considered as well as endoscopic findings. Lymphocytic gastritis (LG) is a rare subtype of chronic gastritis.

Hemorrhagic Diathesis as the Presenting Symptom of Neonatal Cholestasis | Hemorrhagic Diathesis as the Presenting Symptom of Neonatal Cholestasis,"A 4-week-old infant presented with a coagulation disorder resulting from a vitamin K deficiency. The vitamin K defi-ciency was caused by neonatal cholestasis due to biliary atresia. Jaundice, hepatomegaly and pale stools are the predominant presenting symptoms of biliary atresia, none of which were recognized in our patient before admission. However, the patient presented with bleeding caused by vitamin K deficiency. She was fully breastfed and had re-ceived adequate doses of vitamin K at birth and from the age of 1 week. In case of a hemorrhagic diathesis due to neonatal cholestasis, timely identification of treatable underlying disorders, in particular biliary atresia, is important because an early surgical intervention results in a better prognosis. Meticulous history taking and a thorough physical exam can be decisive for an early diagnosis and subsequent intervention.

How Should the Pyloric Submucosal Mass Coexisting with Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis Be Treated?: A Case of Pyloric Ectopic Pancreas with Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis | How Should the Pyloric Submucosal Mass Coexisting with Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis Be Treated?: A Case of Pyloric Ectopic Pancreas with Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis,"Co-existing pyloric submucosal masses with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) are very rare and treating these lesions is always a problem. A 20-day-old boy presented with recurrent episodes of projectile non-bilious vomiting lasting for 5 days. HPS was suspected due to the presenting age and the symptoms. The sonography demonstrated not only circumferential wall thickening of the pylorus, but also a pyloric submucosal mass. At laparotomy, a 0.8 cm sized pyloric submucosal mass was identified along with a hypertrophied pylorus. Pyloric excision was performed due to the possibility of sustaining the symptoms and malignancy. The pathological report of the submucosal mass was ectopic pancreas. Coexisting pyloric lesions can be diagnosed along with HPS, and surgical excision, not just pyloromyotomy, should be considered in these circumstances.

Clonazepam Treatment of Pathologic Aerophagia in Children with Mental Retardation | Clonazepam Treatment of Pathologic Aerophagia in Children with Mental Retardation,"Purpose: Pathologic aerophagia (PA) may lead to bowel perforation or volvulus in mentally retarded patients. The authors investigated the effects of clonazepam on the management of PA in children with severe to profound mental retardation (MR).
Methods: This study was undertaken as a retrospective case analysis of 21 PA patients with MR who were followed for over 12 months and diagnosed as having PA. Patients were assigned to two management groups, that is, to a clonazepam randomized open-labeled, treatment group or a reassurance group. The following were recorded and analyzed; age, response, remission rate to clonazepam treatment, and the side effect of clonazepam. It was defined positive response (response+) as being symptom-free for a whole week within 1 month of commencing treatment and remission(+) as being symptom-free for a whole month within 6 months of treatment.
Results: The average age of the 21 PA children with MR was 10 years and 13 patients were female. Symptom duration before diagnosis of PA was 7 months. Clinical features of the clonazepam-trial group (n=11) and the reassurance group (n=10) were non-significantly different. Response(+) was achieved by 2 patients (18.2%) in the clonazepamtrial group and by no patient in the reassurance group. Remission(+) was achieved by 6 patients (54.5%) in the clonazepam- trial group and by one patient (10%) in the reassurance group (p=0.040).
Conclusion: When PA children with MR with severe bowel distention are considered for surgical treatment to prevent acute abdomen, a trial of clonazepam could be recommended.

Short-Term Complications of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy according to the Type of Technique | Short-Term Complications of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy according to the Type of Technique,"Purpose: The method of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement can be divided into the pull and introducer techniques. We compared short-term complications and prognosis between patients who underwent the pull technique and two other types of introducer techniques, the trocar introducer technique and T-fastener gastropexy technique.
Methods: Twenty-six patients who underwent PEG were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively investigated the age, sex, body weight, weight-for-age Z-score, underlying diseases, PEG indications, complications, duration of NPO (nil per os), pain control frequency, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The patients were classified into three groups according to the PEG technique. The occurrence of complications was monitored for 10 weeks after the procedure.
Results: The age, sex, body weight, and weight-for-age Z-score were not significantly between the three groups.
Most patients had cerebral palsy and seizure disorders. Dysphagia was the most common indication for PEG. Major complications occurred in 5 (50%), 4 (66.7%), and 0 (0%) patients in group I, II, and III, respectively (p=0.005). Further, peristomal infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy occurred in 2 (20%), 3 (50%), and 0 (0%) patients in group I, II, and III, respectively (p=0.04). There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to minor complications, duration of NPO, pain control frequency, and duration of antibiotic therapy.

Systemic Classification for a New Diagnostic Approach to Acute Abdominal Pain in Children | Systemic Classification for a New Diagnostic Approach to Acute Abdominal Pain in Children,"Purpose: With previous methods based on only age and location, there are many difficulties in identifying the etiology of acute abdominal pain in children. We sought to develop a new systematic classification of acute abdominal pain and to give some helps to physicians encountering difficulties in diagnoses.
Methods: From March 2005 to May 2010, clinical data were collected retrospectively from 442 children hospitalized due to acute abdominal pain with no apparent underlying disease. According to the final diagnoses, diseases that caused acute abdominal pain were classified into nine groups.
Results: The nine groups were group I “catastrophic surgical abdomen” (7 patients, 1.6%), group II “acute appendicitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis” (56 patients, 12.7%), group III “intestinal obstruction” (57 patients, 12.9%), group IV “viral and bacterial acute gastroenteritis” (90 patients, 20.4%), group V “peptic ulcer and gastroduodenitis” (66 patients, 14.9%), group VI “hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease” (14 patients, 3.2%), group VII “febrile viral illness and extraintestinal infection” (69 patients, 15.6%), group VIII “functional gastrointestinal disorder (acute manifestation)” (20 patients, 4.5%), and group IX “unclassified acute abdominal pain” (63 patients, 14.3%). Four patients were enrolled in two disease groups each.
Conclusion: Patients were distributed unevenly across the nine groups of acute abdominal pain. In particular, the “unclassified abdominal pain” only group was not uncommon.

Clinical Characteristics of Symptomatic Clostridium difficile Infection in Children: Conditions as Infection Risks and Whether Probiotics Is Effective | Clinical Characteristics of Symptomatic Clostridium difficile Infection in Children: Conditions as Infection Risks and Whether Probiotics Is Effective,"Purpose: This study investigated the clinical presentations of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in children.
Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 43 children aged ＜20 years who showed either positive C. difficile culture or C. difficile toxin test results between June 2010 and April 2014.
Results: Of the 43 patients (mean age 6.7 years), 22 were boys. Sixteen patients (37.2%) showed both positive C. difficile culture and toxin test results. Seventeen out of 43 children (39.5%) had preexisting gastrointestinal diseases, and 26 children had other medical conditions that were risk factors for CDI. Twenty-eight children had a history of antibiotic treatment for ＞3 days, and the most frequently prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin-clavulanate (35.7%).
Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with CDI despite taking probiotic supplements, most commonly Lactobacillus acidophilus (53.6%). The most common symptom was diarrhea (72.1%) at the time CDI was diagnosed. C. difficile was eradicated in 11 patients (25.6%) after treatment with oral metronidazole for 10-14 days, and in the two patients (4.6%) who required two courses of oral metronidazole. Sixteen patients (37.2%) showed clinical improvement without any treatment.
Conclusion: This study showed the various clinical characteristics of CDI in children and that preexisting clinical conditions favored the development of CDI. In addition, CDI was found to occur in a number of patients even after probiotic prophylaxis given in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

GSD Ia was diagnosed in 7 patients (33.3%), Ib in 1 patient (4.8%), III in 2 patients (9.5%), IV in 1 patient (4.8%), and IX in 6 patients (28.6%). Types other than GSD I constituted 52.9% (9/17) of the patients diagnosed with a specific type of hepatic GSD. The median age at presentation was 2 years. Hepatomegaly was observed in 95.2%, elevated liver transaminases in 90.5%, and hyperlactacidemia in 81.0% of the patients. The duration for follow-up was 77±62.0 months. Uncooked corn starch was initiated in all the patients. No mortality was observed during the follow-up period, and liver transplantation was performed in 14.3%.
Conclusion: Types other than GSD I comprised more than half of the patients diagnosed with a specific type of hepatic GSD. Clinical suspicion and thorough evaluation of hepatic GSDs in Korea should be focused not only on GSD I, but also on other types. Purpose: There are no studies of hepatic glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) other than type I and III in Korea. We aimed on investigating the characteristics of hepatic GSDs in Korea diagnosed and followed at a single center.

The Clinical Significance of Serum Ferritin in Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease | The Clinical Significance of Serum Ferritin in Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Purpose: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children has become an important public health issue because of its high prevalence and severity. Several noninvasive methods for estimating NAFLD are under investigation.
We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of serum ferritin as a biomarker of severity of pediatric NAFLD patients.
Methods: A total of 64 NAFLD patient were enrolled from Severance Children’s Hospital from March 2010 to February 2013. Serum ferritin levels, liver related laboratory tests, liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (2-dimensional [2D] proton density-fat fraction) and NAFLD severity markers were compared between obese group and overweight group. Correlation analyses were performed between serum ferritin and laboratory values including NAFLD severity markers.
Results: In obese group, serum ferritin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), MRI 2D proton density-fat fraction, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis- 4 (FIB-4) (an index score calculated from platelet count, ALT, AST and age) were significantly higher than those of overweight group. NAFLD severity markers, APRI and FIB-4, and liver specific important laboratory values, AST, ALT, INR, cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein show significant correlation with serum ferritin in NAFLD patients.
Conclusion: Serum ferritin concentrations could be a candidate of useful severity marker in the pediatric NAFLD patients.

The Complex Surgical Management of the First Case of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency and Multiple Intestinal Atresias Surviving after the Fourth Year of Life | The Complex Surgical Management of the First Case of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency and Multiple Intestinal Atresias Surviving after the Fourth Year of Life,"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a life-threatening syndrome of recurrent infections and gastro-intestinal alterations due to severe compromise of T cells and B cells. Clinically, most patients present symptoms before the age of 3 months and without intervention SCID usually results in severe infections and death by the age of 2 years. Its association with intestinal anomalies as multiple intestinal atresias (MIA) is rare and worsens the prog-nosis, resulting lethal. We describe the case of a four year-old boy with SCID-MIA. He presented at birth with meco-nium peritonitis, multiple ileal atresias and underwent several intestinal resections. A targeted Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous 4-bp deletion (c.313ΔTATC; p.Y105fs) in tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A (TTC7A).He experienced surgical procedures including resection and stricturoplasty. Despite parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease, the patient is surviving at the time of writing the report. Precocious immune system assessment, scrutiny of TTC7A mutations and prompt surgical procedures are crucial in the management.

Middle East Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Management of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in <12 Months Old Infants | Middle East Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Management of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in <12 Months Old Infants,"This paper covers algorithms for the management of regurgitation, constipation and infantile colic in infants. Anti-re-gurgitation formula may be considered in infants with troublesome regurgitation, while diagnostic investigations or drug therapy are not indicated in the absence of warning signs. Although probiotics have shown some positive evi-dence for the management of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), the evidence is not strong enough to make a recommendation. A partially hydrolyzed infant formula with prebiotics and β-palmitate may be considered as a dietary intervention for functional constipation in formula fed infants. Lactulose has been shown to be effective and safe in infants younger than 6 months that are constipated. Macrogol (polyethylene glycol, PEG) is not approved for use in infants less than 6 months of age. However, PEG is preferred over lactulose in infants ＞6 months of age. Limited data suggests that infant formula with a partial hydrolysate, galacto-oligosaccharides/fructo-oligosac-charides, added β-palmitate may be of benefit in reducing infantile colic in formula fed infants in cases where cow’smilk protein allergy (CMPA) is not suspected. Evidence suggests that the use of extensively hydrolyzed infant formula for a formula-fed baby and a cow’s milk free diet for a breastfeeding mother may be beneficial to decrease infantile colic if CMPA is suspected. None of the FGIDs is a reason to stop breastfeeding. This paper covers algorithms for the management of regurgitation, constipation and infantile colic in infants.

Socioeconomic Impacts of Gluten-Free Diet among Saudi Children with Celiac Disease | Socioeconomic Impacts of Gluten-Free Diet among Saudi Children with Celiac Disease,"Purpose: To determine the socio-economic impact of gluten free diet (GFD) on Saudi children and their families Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which an online questionnaire was sent to all families registered in the Saudi celiac patients support group. We included only children (age 18 years of age and younger) with biop-sy-confirmed celiac disease (CD).Results: A total of 113 children were included in the final analysis, the median age was 9.9 years; 62.8% were females. One hundred (88.5%) of the participating families reported that GFD food was not easily available in their areas, 17% of them reported that it was not available at all in their area. One hundred and six (93.8%) reported that the price of GFD food was very expensive and 70 (61.9%) families that the diet was heavily affecting their family budget. Significant social difficulties were reported among the participating families and their children including interference with the child’s interaction with other children (49.6%), the families’ ability to attend social gatherings (60.2%), the families’ ability to eat in restaurants (73.5%), and the families’ ability to travel (58.4%). Conclusion: There is significant negative socio-economic impact of GFD on children with CD & their families. Health care providers should be aware of these psycho-social difficulties and be well trained to provide a proper education and psychological support for these patients and their families.

HSP occurred most frequently in the winter (33.0%) and least frequently in the summer (11.3%). Palpable purpura spots were found in 208 patients (98.1%), and gastrointestinal (GI) and joint symptoms were observed in 159 (75.0%) and 148 (69.8%) patients, respectively. There were 57 patients (26.9%) with renal involvement and 10 patients (4.7%) with nephrotic syndrome. The incidence of renal involvement and nephrotic syndrome was significantly higher in patients with se-vere GI symptoms and in those over 7 years old. The majority of patients (88.7%) were treated with steroids. There was no significant difference in the incidence of renal involvement or nephrotic syndrome among patients receiving different doses of steroids. Conclusion: In this study, the epidemiologic features of HSP in children were similar to those described in previous studies, but GI and joint symptoms manifested more frequently. It is essential to carefully monitor renal involvement and progression to chronic renal disease in patients ≥7 years old and in patients affected by severe GI symptoms.

Correlation between Colon Transit Time Test Value and Initial Maintenance Dose of Laxative in Children with Chronic Functional Constipation | Correlation between Colon Transit Time Test Value and Initial Maintenance Dose of Laxative in Children with Chronic Functional Constipation,"Purpose: To evaluate the correlation between colon transit time (CTT) test value and initial maintenance dose of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 or lactulose.Methods: Of 415 children with chronic functional constipation, 190 were enrolled based on exclusion criteria using the CTT test, defecation diary, and clinical chart. The CTT test was performed with prior disimpaction. The laxative dose for maintenance was determined on the basis of the defecation diary and clinical chart. The Shapiro-Wilk test and Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results: The overall group median value and interquartile range of the CTT test was 43.8 (31.8) hours. The average PEG 4000 dose for maintenance in the overall group was 0.68±0.18 g/kg/d; according to age, the dose was 0.73±0.16g/kg/d (＜8 years), 0.53±0.12 g/kg/d (8 to ＜12 years), and 0.36±0.05 g/kg/d (12 to 15 years). The dose of lactulose was 1.99±0.43 mL/kg/d (＜8 years) or 1.26±0.25 mL/kg/d (8 to ＜12 years). There was no significant correlation between CTT test value and initial dose of laxative, irrespective of the subgroup (encopresis, abnormal CTT test subtype) for either laxative. Even in the largest group (overall, n=109, younger than 8 years and on PEG 4000), the correlation was weak (Pearson’s correlation coefficient [R]=0.268, p=0.005). Within the abnormal transit group, sub-group (n=73, younger than 8 years and on PEG 4000) correlation was weak (R=0.267, p=0.022). Conclusion: CTT test value cannot predict the initial maintenance dose of PEG 4000 or lactulose with linear correlation.

Spontaneous Perforation of Colon in Previously Healthy Infantsand Children: Its Clinical Implication | Spontaneous Perforation of Colon in Previously Healthy Infantsand Children: Its Clinical Implication,"Purpose: Spontaneous colon perforations are usually encountered as necrotizing enterocolitis in the neonatal period, but occur rarely in infants and children without pathological conditions. This study was conducted to describe its clinical implication beyond the neonatal period. Methods: Cases of spontaneous colon perforation confirmed after the operation were reviewed retrospectively and the clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Clinical data were compared according to the presence of pneumoperitoneum as initial findings. Results: Eleven patients were included in the study period and showed a history of hospitalization before transfer due to management for fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal problems. Six patients showed a sudden onset of abdomi-nal distention and only seven patients showed a pneumoperitoneum as initial radiologic findings, however there were no significant clinicopathological differences. Perforation was found evenly in all segments of the colon, most commonly at the sigmoid colon in four cases. There were no specific pathologic or serologic causes of perforation. Conclusion: When previously healthy infants and children manifest a sustained fever with a sudden onset of abdomi-nal distention during management for fever associated with respiratory or gastrointestinal problems, there is a great likelihood of colon perforation with no pathological condition. Prompt surgical management as timely decision-mak-ing is necessary in order to achieve a good progress.

Conclusion: When previously healthy infants and children manifest a sustained fever with a sudden onset of abdomi-nal distention during management for fever associated with respiratory or gastrointestinal problems, there is a great likelihood of colon perforation with no pathological condition. Prompt surgical management as timely decision-mak-ing is necessary in order to achieve a good progress.",김수홍(부산대학교); 조용훈(부산대학교); 김해영(부산대학교),소아과학,2016-09,영어
"Associations among the Degree of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Metabolic Syndrome, Degree of Obesity in Children, and Parental Obesity | Associations among the Degree of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Metabolic Syndrome, Degree of Obesity in Children, and Parental Obesity","Purpose: To analyze the associations among the degrees of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ultra-sonography and metabolic syndrome, degrees of obesity in children, and degrees of parental obesity. Methods: A total of 198 children with obesity who visited a pediatric obesity clinic were prospectively enrolled in this study. The severity of NAFLD based on ultrasonography was classified into no, mild, moderate, or severe NAFLD group. The degree of obesity based on the percentage over standard weight for height per sex was classified into mild, moderate, or severe. Results: Of 132 patients evaluated for the degree of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome, the p-value of correlation between the two factors was 0.009. Therefore, metabolic syndrome might significantly affect the degree of NAFLD. Of 158 patients evaluated for the degree of NAFLD and the degree of obesity, the p-value of correlation between the two factors was 0.122. Of 154 patients evaluated for the degree of obesity and father’s obesity, the p-value was 0.076. Of 159 patients evaluated for the degree of obesity and mother’s obesity, the p-value was 0.000, indicating that mother’s obesity could significantly affect the degree of obesity in children. Of 142 patients evaluated for the degree of obesity and metabolic syndrome, the p-value was 0.288. Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome might significantly affect the degree of nonalcoholic fatty liver in children. In addition, mother’s obesity might be a significant factor that affects the degree of obesity in children.

Corrosive Esophagitis with Benzalkonium Chloride in a Two Days Old Neonate | Corrosive Esophagitis with Benzalkonium Chloride in a Two Days Old Neonate,"Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is a caustic agent which is used in farms, homes and hospitals for cleaning skin and wounds as an antiseptic solution. It may lead to digestive system injuries in case of ingestion. We present a two-days-old newborn case which was carried to the emergency unit with complaints of poor breastfeeding, uneasi-ness and crying for 4-6 hours. Her mom confessed that she had given a spoon of 10% BAC solution for her cough. Initial laboratory tests were in normal ranges. A gastroscopy performed in the second hour of her admission revealed an hyperemic and edematous mucosa in the middle third of esophagus and a circumferential ulceration followed in the distal portion. Hereupon, a conservative treatment for 10 days was administered and the control gastroscopy demonstrated that the damage was almost totally improved. She was the youngest case with this etiology and suc-cessfully treated with conservative approach.

Failure of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in a Three-Year-Old Child with Severe Refractory Ulcerative Colitis | Failure of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in a Three-Year-Old Child with Severe Refractory Ulcerative Colitis,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a treatment designed to correct gut dysbiosis by administration of feces from a healthy volunteer. It is still unclear whether FMT for children with ulcerative colitis (UC) is effective or hazardous. Here we describe a young patient to have received FMT for UC. A three-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with severe active UC, and treated with aminosalicylates and various immunosuppressive drugs. As remission was not achieved, we decided to try FMT before colectomy. We administered donor fecal material a total of six times by retention enema (×2) and via a nasoduodenal tube (×4) within 10 days. The patient developed abdominal pain and pyrexia after each FMT session. Analyses revealed the transferred donor fecal microbiota had not been retained by the patient, who ultimately underwent colectomy. The severity of the UC and/or timing of FMT may have partly accounted for the poor outcome.

Poor Prognostic Factors in Patients with Parenteral Nutrition-Dependent Pediatric Intestinal Failure | Poor Prognostic Factors in Patients with Parenteral Nutrition-Dependent Pediatric Intestinal Failure,"Purpose: Parenteral nutrition (PN) not only provides nutritional support but also plays a crucial role in the treatment of children with intestinal failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance and clinical outcomes of long-term PN.Methods: Retrospective cohort study was conducted using the medical records of patients treated at Seoul National University Children’s Hospital. This study included 19 patients who received PN for over six months. Most patients received home PN.Results: The indications for PN included short bowel syndrome, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and intract-able diarrhea of infancy. The median age of PN initiation was 1.3 years, and the median treatment duration was 2.9 years. Two patients were weaned from PN; 14 continued to receive PN with enteral feedings; and 3 patients died. The overall survival rates at 2 and 5 years were 93.3% and 84.0%, respectively. The incidence of catheter-re-lated bloodstream infections was 2.7/1,000 catheter-days and was associated with younger age at PN initiation and lower initial height Z-score. Six patients developed catheter-related central vein thrombosis, with an incidence of 0.25/1,000 catheter-days. Eleven patients experienced PN-associated liver disease (PNALD), and one patient un-derwent multi-visceral transplant. The patients with PNALD exhibited lower final heights and body weight Z-scores. All patients experienced micronutrient deficiencies transiently while receiving PN.Conclusion: PN is an important and safe treatment for pediatric intestinal failure. PNALD was linked to final anthro-pometric poor outcomes. Micronutrient deficiencies were common. Anthropometric measurements and micro-nutrient levels must be monitored for successful PN completion.

Esophageal Stricture Secondary to Candidiasis in a Child with Glycogen Storage Disease 1b | Esophageal Stricture Secondary to Candidiasis in a Child with Glycogen Storage Disease 1b,"Esophageal candidiasis is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients; however, candida esophagitis induced stricture is a very rare complication. We report the first case of esophageal stricture secondary to candidiasis in a glycogen storage disease (GSD) 1b child. The patient was diagnosed with GSD type 1b by liver biopsy. No mutation was found in the G6PC gene, but SLC37A4 gene sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation (p.R28H and p.W107X, which was a novel mutation). The patient’s absolute neutrophil count was continuously under 1,000/µLwhen he was over 6 years of age. He was admitted frequently for recurrent fever and infection, and frequently received intravenous antibiotics, antifungal agents. He complained of persistent dysphagia beginning at age 7 years. Esophageal stricture and multiple whitish patches were observed by endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy revealed numerous fungal hyphae consistent with candida esophagitis.

He received esophageal balloon dilatation four times, and his symptoms improved.",이경재(서울대학교); 최신지(서울대학교); 김우선(서울대학교); 박성섭(서울대학교); 문진수(서울대학교병원); 고재성(서울대학교),소아과학,2016-03,영어
Gastroesophageal Reflux Affects Sleep Quality in Snoring Obese Children | Gastroesophageal Reflux Affects Sleep Quality in Snoring Obese Children,"Purpose: This study was performed to evaluate the quality of sleep in snoring obese children without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); and to study the possible relationship between sleep interruption and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in snoring obese children.Methods: Study subjects included 13 snoring obese children who were referred to our sleep lab for possible sleep-dis-ordered breathing. Patients underwent multichannel intraluminal impedance and esophageal pH monitoring with simultaneous polysomnography. Exclusion criteria included history of fundoplication, cystic fibrosis, and infants un-der the age of 2 years. Significant association between arousals and awakenings with previous reflux were defined by symptom-association probability using 2-minute intervals.Results: Sleep efficiency ranged from 67-97% (median 81%). A total of 111 reflux episodes (90% acidic) were de-tected during sleep, but there were more episodes per hour during awake periods after sleep onset than during sleep (median 2.3 vs. 0.6, p=0.04). There were 279 total awakenings during the sleep study; 56 (20.1%) of them in 9 patients (69.2%) were preceded by reflux episodes (55 acid, 1 non-acid). In 5 patients (38.5%), awakenings were significantly associated with reflux.Conclusion: The data suggest that acid GER causes sleep interruptions in obese children who have symptoms of snoring or restless sleep and without evidence of OSA.

Novel Mutations in the CPT1A Gene Identified in the Patient Presenting Jaundice as the First Manifestation of Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A Deficiency | Novel Mutations in the CPT1A Gene Identified in the Patient Presenting Jaundice as the First Manifestation of Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A Deficiency,"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is an enzyme functioning in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) of the liver. Patients with CPT1A deficiency have impaired mitochondrial FAO and display hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hepatic encephalopathy as typical manifestations. In this report, we present a case of CPT1A deficiency present-ing jaundice as the first manifestation. A 1.9 years old boy showed jaundice and elevated levels of free and total carnitine were observed. From direct sequencing analysis of CPT1A, two novel mutations, c.1163+1G＞A and c.1393G＞A (p.Gly465Arg), were identified. At the age of 2.2 years, hypoglycemia, tachycardia, and altered mental status developed just after cranioplasty for craniosynostosis. High glucose infusion rate was required for recovery of his vital signs and mentality. Diet rich in high carbohydrate, low fat and inclusion of medium chain triglyceride oil resulted in improvement in cholestatic hepatitis and since then the boy has shown normal growth velocity and developmental milestones to date.

Foreign Body Ingestion in Children: Should Button Batteries in the Stomach Be Urgently Removed? | Foreign Body Ingestion in Children: Should Button Batteries in the Stomach Be Urgently Removed?,"Purpose: Foreign body (FB) ingestion is common in children, and button battery (BB) ingestion has been increasing in recent years. This study was to identify factors related to outcomes of FB ingestion, particularly BBs in the stomach. We evaluated whether the current recommendations are appropriate and aimed to suggest indications for endo-scopic removal of BB in the stomach in young children.Methods: We investigated patient age, shape, size, location of FBs, spontaneous passage time and resulting compli-cations among 76 children. We observed types, size, location of BB and outcomes, and analyzed their associations with complications.Results: Coins and BB were the two most common FBs. Their shapes and sizes were not associated with the sponta-neous passage time. Size, spontaneous passage time, and age were also not associated with any specific complications. For BB ingestion, all 5 cases with lithium batteries (≥1.5 cm, 3 V) presented moderate to major compli-cations in the esophagus and stomach without any symptoms, even when the batteries were in the stomach and beyond the duodenum, while no complications were noted in 7 cases with alkaline batteries (＜1.5 cm, 1.5 V) (p=0.001). All endoscopies were conducted within 24 hours after ingestion.Conclusion: The type and voltage of the battery should be considered when determining whether endoscopy is re-quired to remove a BB in the stomach. For lithium battery ingestion in young children, urgent endoscopic removal might be important in order to prevent complications, even if the child is asymptomatic and the battery is smaller than 2 cm.

Efficacy and Safety of Low Dose Ketamine and Midazolam Combination for Diagnostic Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopyin Children | Efficacy and Safety of Low Dose Ketamine and Midazolam Combination for Diagnostic Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopyin Children,"Purpose: We aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of low-dose midazolam and ketamine combination for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) in children.Methods: The study included the children (n=425, 10.78±3.81 years) who underwent UGIE for diagnostic purpose during 1 year period. All children were sedated with low dose midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) intravenously. Effectiveness of the sedation and complications during the procedure and recovery period were recorded. Results: Endoscopic procedure was successfully completed in 414 patients (97.4%; 95% confidence interval, 95.8-98.9). Mean±standard deviation (SD) duration of procedure was 6.36±1.64 minutes (median, 6.0 minutes; range, 4-12 minutes). Minor complications occurred during the procedure in 39.2% of the patients. The most common complication was increased oral secretion (33.1%). No major complications were observed in any patient. Age and Ramsay sedation scores of patients with complications during the procedure were lower than the others (9.49±4.05years vs. 11.61±3.43 years, p=0.002 and 2.10±1.46 vs. 4.37±1.16, p=0.001). Mean recovery time was 22 minutes (range, 10-90 minutes; mean±SD, 25±12.32 minutes). Minor complications developed during recovery in 60.1% of the patients. The most common complication was transient double vision (n=127, 30.7%). Emergence reaction was observed in 5 patients (1.2%).

Low Serum Potassium Levels Associated with Disease Severity in Children with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease | Low Serum Potassium Levels Associated with Disease Severity in Children with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Purpose: Recent studies have suggested that decreased serum potassium level may contribute to various metabolic disorders in adult patients including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to study the correlation between serum potassium levels and the histologic severity of NAFLD in children. Methods: Pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, and histo-pathological data were obtained. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess whether potassium levels are associated with the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or fibrosis after adjusting for possible confounders. A p-value ＜0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among 125 biopsies, 49.6% (62) had evidence of NASH while 66.4% (83) had some degree of fibrosis (stage 1-3). Mean serum potassium was significantly lower in NASH group as compared to non-NASH group (4.4±0.42mmoL/L vs. 4.8±0.21, p＜0.001). Higher potassium level had negative correlation with presence of steatosis, balloon-ing, lobular inflammation, fibrosis and NAFLD activity score (p＜0.05). On multivariable analysis and after adjusting for the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, higher potassium level was significantly associated with lower likelihood of having a histological diagnosis of NASH on biopsy (odds ratio [OR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.05-0.28; p＜0.001). Similarly, the likelihood of having fibrosis decreases by 76% for every 0.5 mmoL/L increase in potassium (OR ,0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.54; p＜0.001).Conclusion: Our study shows an inverse relationship between serum potassium levels and the presence of ag-gressive disease (NASH and fibrosis) in children with NAFLD.

Outcome of Alagille Syndrome Patients Who Had Previously Received Kasai Operation during Infancy: A Single Center Study | Outcome of Alagille Syndrome Patients Who Had Previously Received Kasai Operation during Infancy: A Single Center Study,"Purpose: Infants with Alagille syndrome (AGS) are occasionally misdiagnosed as biliary atresia and subsequently undergo Kasai operation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcome of patients with AGS who had previously received Kasai operation during infancy.Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center. We compared the prognosis and mortality between those who had undergone Kasai operation during infancy (Kasai group) and those who had not (non-Kasai group).Results: Among the 15 children with AGS, five had received Kasai operation, while 10 had not. All subjects in the Kasai group revealed neonatal cholestasis, while 70% of the non-Kasai group showed neonatal cholestasis. Liver transplantation was performed in 100% (5/5) among the Kasai group, and 20.0% (2/10) among the non-Kasai group (p=0.007). Mortality was observed in 60.0% (3/5) among the Kasai group, and 10.0% (1/10) among the non-Kasai group (p=0.077). Conclusion: Although overall mortality rate did not significantly differ between the two groups, the proportion of pa-tients receiving liver transplantation was significantly higher in the non-Kasai group. The relatively worse outcome in AGS patients who had received Kasai operation may be due to the unfavorable influences of Kasai operation on the clinical course of AGS, or maybe due to neonatal cholestasis, irrespective of the Kasai operation.

Asymptomatic Bile Duct Dilatation in Children: Is It a Disease? | Asymptomatic Bile Duct Dilatation in Children: Is It a Disease?,"Purpose: Bile duct dilatation is a relatively common sonographic finding; nevertheless, its clinical significance in children is controversial because little research has been done in the area. Therefore, we investigated the natural course and clinical significance of biliary duct dilatation in children.Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 181 children (range, 1-day-old to 17-year-old) in whom dilatation of the intrahepatic duct and/or common hepatic duct and/or common bile duct was detected by abdominal ultra-sonography at the Severance Children's Hospital between November 2005 and March 2014. We reviewed and ana-lyzed laboratory test results, clinical manifestations, and clinical course in these patients.Results: Pediatric patients (n=181) were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups. The first group included 59 subjects, without definitive cause of bile duct dilatation, who did not require treatment; the second group included 122 subjects, with definitive cause of bile duct dilatation or underlying biliary disease, who did require treatment. In the first group, 24 patients (40.7%) showed spontaneous resolution of bile duct dilatation, 20 patients (33.9%) showed no change, and 15 patients (25.4%) were lost to follow-up. In the second group, 31 patients were diagnosed with choledochal cysts, and 91 patients presented with biliary tract dilatations due to secondary causes, such as gallbladder or liver disease, post-operative complications, or malignancy.Conclusion: Biliary dilatation in pediatric patients without symptoms, and without laboratory and other sonographic abnormalities, showed a benign clinical course.

Diagnostic Value of Ceruloplasmin in the Diagnosis of PediatricWilson’s Disease | Diagnostic Value of Ceruloplasmin in the Diagnosis of PediatricWilson’s Disease,"Purpose: Measurement of serum ceruloplasmin level is the first step in screening for Wilson's disease (WD). Despite the rarity of WD in the general population, ceruloplasmin levels are routinely measured through hepatitis screening in both adults and children. Herein, we evaluated the diagnostic value of ceruloplasmin for the diagnosis of WD among children with hepatitis.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on serum ceruloplasmin levels measured as a serologic marker for pa-tients with hepatitis at Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) between from January 2004 to November 2013. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed by the identification of pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ceruloplasmin, receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the area under curve (AUC) were calculated. Results: Measurements of serum ceruloplasmin were performed in 2,834 children who had hepatitis. Among these, 181 (6.4%) children were diagnosed with WD. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a ceruloplasmin level of ＜20 mg/dL in the discrimination of WD were 93.4%, 84.2%, and 84.8%, respectively. In this study, 418 (14.7%) false-positive cases and 12 (0.4%) false-negative cases were noted. Using a ROC curve, a ceruloplasmin level of ≤16.6 mg/dL showed the highest AUC value (0.956) with a sensitivity of 91.2%, a specificity of 94.9%, and an accu-racy of 94.7%.Conclusion: The measurement of serum ceruloplasmin was frequently used for the screening of WD in children, despite a low positive rate. The diagnostic value of ceruloplasmin may be strengthened by adopting a new lower cut-off level.

We present a case of a Y-shaped tubular colonic duplication which presented with a rectovestibular fistula and a normal anus. Radiological evaluation and initial exploration for sigmoidostomy revealed duplicated colons with a common vascular supply. Endorectal mucosal resection of theduplicated distal segment till the colostomy site with division of the septum of the proximal segment and colostomy closure proved curative without compromise of the continence mechanism.

Early Life Factors Influencing the Risk of Obesity | Early Life Factors Influencing the Risk of Obesity,"The obesity epidemic is a worldwide problem. Factors predisposing to obesity include genetics, race, socioeconomic conditions, birth by cesarean section, and perinatal antibiotic use. High protein (HP) content in infant formulas has been identified as a potential culprit predisposing to rapid weight gain in the first few months of life and leading to later obesity. In a large multicountry study the effects of lower protein (LP) formula (1.77 and 2.2 g protein/100 kcal, before and after the 5th month, respectively) were compared to those of higher protein (2.9 and 4.4 g protein/100 kcal, respectively). Results indicated that at 24 months, the weight-for-length z score of infants in the LP formula group was 0.20 (0.06, 0.34) lower than that of the HP group and was similar to that of the breastfed reference group. The authors concluded that a HP content of infant formula is associated with higher weight in the first 2 years of life but has no effect on length. LP intake in infancy might diminish the later risk of overweight and obesity. At 6 years of age HP children had a significantly higher body mass index (by 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.90; p=0.009) and a 2.43 (95% CI, 1.12-5.27; p=0.024) fold greater risk of becoming obese than those who received the LP. In conclusion, several factors may influence development of metabolic syndrome and obesity. Breastfeeding should always be encouraged. An overall reduction of protein intake in formula non breastfed infants seems to be an additional way to prevent obesity. The obesity epidemic is a worldwide problem.

Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome: A Functional Disorder | Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome: A Functional Disorder,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a functional disorder characterized by stereotypical episodes of intense vomiting separated by weeks to months. Although it can occur at any age, the most common age at presentation is 3-7 years. There is no gender predominance. The precise pathophysiology of CVS is not known but a strong association with migraine headaches, in the patient as well as the mother indicates that it may represent a mitochondriopathy. Studies have also suggested the role of an underlying autonomic neuropathy involving the sympathetic nervous system in its pathogenesis. CVS has known triggers in many individuals and avoiding these triggers can help prevent the onset of the episodes. It typically presents in four phases: a prodrome, vomiting phase, recovery phase and an asympto-matic phase until the next episode. Complications such as dehydration and hematemesis from Mallory Wise tear of the esophageal mucosa may occur in more severe cases. Blood and urine tests and abdominal imaging may be indicated depending upon the severity of symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may also be indicated in certain circumstances. Management of an episode after it has started (‘abortivetreatment’) includes keeping the patient in a dark and quiet room, intravenous hydration, ondansetron, sumatriptan, clonidine, and benzodiazepines. Prophylactic treatment includes cyproheptadine, propranolol and amitriptyline. No mortality has been reported as a direct result of CVS and many children outgrow it over time.

Maladaptive Behavior and Gastrointestinal Disorders in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder | Maladaptive Behavior and Gastrointestinal Disorders in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Purpose: Various gastrointestinal factors may contribute to maladaptive behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To determine the association between maladaptive behavior in children with ASD and gastro-intestinal symptoms such as severity, intestinal microbiota, inflammation, enterocyte damage, permeability and ab-sorption of opioid peptides. Methods: This observational cross-sectional study compared children with ASD to healthy controls, aged 2-10 years. Maladaptive behavior was classified using the Approach Withdrawal Problems Composite subtest of the Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory. Dependent variables were gastrointestinal symptom severity index, fecal calprotectin, urinary D-lactate, urinary lactulose/mannitol excretion, urinary intestinal fatty acids binding protein (I-FABP) and urinary opioid peptide excretion.Results: We did not find a significant difference between children with ASD with severe or mild maladaptive behavior and control subjects for gastrointestinal symptoms, fecal calprotectin, urinary D-lactate, and lactulose/mannitol ratio. Urinary opioid peptide excretion was absent in all children. Children with ASD with severe maladaptive behavior showed significantly higher urinary I-FABP levels compared to those with mild maladaptive behavior (p=0.019) and controls (p=0.015). Conclusion: In our series, maladaptive behavior in ASD children was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, intestinal inflammation (no difference in calprotectin), microbiota (no difference in urinary D-lactate) and intestinal permeability (no difference in lactulose/manitol ratio). ASD children with severe maladaptive behavior have sig-nificantly more enterocyte damage (increased urinary I-FABP) than ASD children with mild maladaptive behavior and normal children.

Esophageal Bolus Transit in Newborns with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Symptoms: A Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance Study | Esophageal Bolus Transit in Newborns with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Symptoms: A Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance Study,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate bolus transit during esophageal swallow (ES) and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) events and to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of ES and GER events in a pop-ulation of term and preterm newborns with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Methods: The study population consisted of term and preterm newborns referred to combined multichannel intra-luminal impedance (MII) and pH monitoring for GERD symptoms. The frequency and characteristics of ES and GER events were assessed by two independent investigators. Statistical significance was set at p＜0.05. Results: Fifty-four newborns (23 preterm) were included in the analyses. Median bolus head advancing time cor-rected for esophageal length (BHATc) was shorter during mealtime than during the postprandial period (median, interquartile range): 0.20 (0.15-0.29) s/cm vs. 0.47 (0.39-0.64) s/cm, p＜0.001. Median bolus presence time (BPT) was prolonged during mealtime: 4.71(3.49-6.27) s vs. 2.66 (1.82-3.73) s, p＜0.001. Higher BHATc (p=0.03) and prolonged BPT (p＜0.001) were observed in preterm newborns during the postprandial period. A significant positive correlation between BHATc and bolus clearance time was also observed (ρ=0.33, p=0.016).Conclusion: The analysis of ES and GER events at the same time by MII provides useful information to better under-stand the physiopathology of GERD. In particular, the analysis of BHATc during the postprandial period could help clinicians identify newborns with prolonged esophageal clearance time due to impaired esophageal motility, which could allow for more accurate recommendations regarding further tests and treatment.

Association between Gastric pH and Helicobacter pylori Infection in Children | Association between Gastric pH and Helicobacter pylori Infection in Children,"Purpose: To assess gastric pH and its relationship with urease-test positivity and histological findings in children with Helicobacter pylori infection.Methods: Fasting gastric juices and endoscopic antral biopsy specimens were collected from 562 children and sub-jected to the urease test and histopathological examination. The subjects were divided into 3 age groups: 0-4, 5-9, and 10-15 years. The histopathological grade was assessed using the Updated Sydney System, while the gastric juice pH was determined using a pH meter.Results: The median gastric juice pH did not differ significantly among the age groups (p=0.655). The proportion of individuals with gastric pH ＞4.0 was 1.3% in the 0-4 years group, 6.1% in the 5-9 years group, and 8.2% in 10-15 years (p=0.101). The proportions of moderate and severe chronic gastritis, active gastritis, and H. pylori infiltration increased with age (p＜0.005). Urease-test positivity was higher in children with hypochlorhydria (77.8%) than in those with normal gastric pH (31.7%) (p＜0.001). Chronic and active gastritis were more severe in the former than the latter (p＜0.001), but the degree of H. pylori infiltration did not differ (20.9% vs. 38.9%; p=0.186). Conclusion: Gastric pH while fasting is normal in most children regardless of age.

The Importance of Esophageal and Gastric Diseases as Causes of Chest Pain | The Importance of Esophageal and Gastric Diseases as Causes of Chest Pain,"Purpose: Pediatric chest pain is considered to be idiopathic or caused by benign diseases. This study was to find out how much upper gastrointestinal (UGI) diseases are major causes of chest pain in pediatric patients.Methods: The records of 75 children (42 boys and 33 girls, aged 3-17 years old) who have presented with mainly chest pain from January 1995 to March 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Chest X-ray and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed in all aptients. Further cardiologic and gastrointestinal (GI) evaluations were performed in indicated patients.Results: Chest pain was most common in the children of 6 and 9 to 14 years old. Esopha-gogastric diseases were unexpectedly the most common direct causes of the chest pain, the next are idiopathic, cardiac diseases, chest trauma, respiratory disease, and psychosomatic disease. Even though 21 showed abnormal ECG findings and 7 showed abnormalities on echocardiography, cardiac diseases were determined to be the direct causes only in 9. UGI endoscopy was performed in 57 cases, and esophago-gastric diseases which thereafter were thought to be causative diseases were 48 cases. The mean age of the children with esophago-gastric diseases were different with marginal significance from that of the other children with chest pain not related with esophago-gastric diseases. All the 48 children diagnosed with treated with GI medicines based on the diagnosis, and 37 cases (77.1%) sub-sequently showed clinical improvement.

All the 48 children diagnosed with treated with GI medicines based on the diagnosis, and 37 cases (77.1%) sub-sequently showed clinical improvement. Conclusion: Diagnostic approaches to find out esophageal and gastric diseases in children with chest pain are im-portant as well as cardiac and respiratory investigations.",김용주(한양대학교); Eun Jung Shin(Hanyang University College of Medicine); 김남수(Hanyang University College of Medicine); 이영호(한양대학교); Eun Woo Nam(Hanyang University College of Medicine),소아과학,2015-12,영어
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Korean Children | Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Korean Children,"Purpose: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare condition that can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to evaluate PSC and its association with IBD in children.Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 13 pediatric patients (＜18 years) with PSC treated at Asan Medical Center between June 1989 and December 2013. Clinical findings and long-term outcomes were investigated. During the same period, the incidence of PSC among IBD patients was evaluated among 600 Crohn disease (CD) and 210 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.Results: All 13 study patients diagnosed with PSC also presented with IBD. Eleven boys and two girls with a median age of 15.0 years old (9.0-17.8 years) were included. The cumulative incidence of PSC for UC was 5.7% (12 of 210) and 0.2% for CD (1 of 600), respectively. PSC occurred during follow-up for IBD for five patients (38.5%) whereas, IBD developed during follow-up for PSC for two patients (15.4%), and was diagnosed during the initial work-up for PSC for 6 patients (46.2%). For the 77.3 month median follow-up period, 9/13 patients (69.2%), neither the clinical symptoms nor blood test results worsened. Two cases (15.4%) developed liver cirrhosis and underwent liver transplantation. Among 13 PSC patients with IBD, two (15.4%) developed colorectal cancer, and no one developed cholangiocarcinoma. Conclusion: All patients with PSC in this study had associated IBD. The incidence of PSC was not rare compared to reports in adults. PSC should be considered during the management of IBD and vice versa in children.

A Case of Post-Traumatic Pseudocyst in the Spleen SuccessfullyTreated with Alcohol Sclerotherapy | A Case of Post-Traumatic Pseudocyst in the Spleen SuccessfullyTreated with Alcohol Sclerotherapy,This report details a case of post-traumatic pseudocyst in the spleen that was successfully treated with sclerotherapy using ethanol. A sixteen-year-old boy visited our hospital for a follow-up examination of a splenic cyst. He had experi-enced blunt trauma to the abdomen three years prior to presentation. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a large cyst of the lower pole of the spleen. The cyst was 6.8×9.5×7.0 cm and conservative management was tried. A follow-up ultrasonographic examination three years later revealed that the size of the cyst was unchanged and another treatment was needed to prevent complications. One session of sclerosis with ethanol (90 mL of 99% ethanol) percutaneously was applied to the cyst. A follow-up after four months revealed that the cyst had completely resolved.

Heterotopic Pancreas Presented as Duodenal Tumor with Obstruction | Heterotopic Pancreas Presented as Duodenal Tumor with Obstruction,"Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is defined as pancreatic tissue lacking anatomic and vascular continuity with the main body of the pancreas. Most are asymptomatic, but can cause ulcer, bleeding, intussusception, and mechanical obstruction. Herein, we presented one case of HP presented as duodenal tumor causing duodenal obstruction. A 7-year-old girl visited the emergency room for abdominal pain with vomiting for 24 hours. Computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal series revealed a polypoid mass with short stalk in the 2nd portion of duodenum. We attempted an endoscopic removal. However, the lumen was nearly obstructed by the mass and the stalk was too broad and hard to excise. The mass was surgically removed via duodenotomy. It was confirmed as a HP with ductal and acini components (type 2 by Heinrich classification). Postoperatively, the patient has been well without any com-plication and recurrence.

Mesalizine-Induced Acute Pancreatitis and Interstitial Pneumonitis in a Patient with Ulcerative Colitis | Mesalizine-Induced Acute Pancreatitis and Interstitial Pneumonitis in a Patient with Ulcerative Colitis,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Mesalizine for the first-line therapy of UC has adverse effects include pancreatitis, pneumonia and pericarditis. UC complicated by two coexisting conditions, however, is very rare. Moreover, drug-related pulmonary toxicity is particularly rare. An 11-year-old male patient was hospitalized for recurring upper abdominal pain after meals with vomiting, hematochezia and exertional dyspnea developing at 2 weeks of mesalizine therapy for UC. The serum level of lipase was elevated. Chest X-ray and thorax computed tomography showed interstitial pneumonitis. Mesalizine was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Five days after admission, symptoms were resolved and mesalizine was resumed after a drop in amylase and lipase level. Symptoms returned the following day, however, accompanied by increased the serum levels of amylase and lipase. Mesalizine was discontinued again and recurring symptoms rapidly improved.

Characteristics of Pediatric Pancreatitis on Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography | Characteristics of Pediatric Pancreatitis on Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography,"Pediatric pancreatitis is not uncommon and results in considerable morbidity and mortality in the affected children. Unlike adults, pediatric pancreatitis is more frequently associated with underlying structural abnormalities, trauma, and drugs rather than an idiopathic etiology. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a good imag-ing modality for evaluating pancreatitis and determining etiology without exposure to radiation. This article focuses on MRCP findings associated with various causes of pancreatitis in children, particularly structural abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary system, as well as describing the feasibility, limitations, and solutions associated with pedia-tric MRCP.

The Iron Status of Very Low Birth Weight Infants Receiving Multiple Erythrocyte Transfusions during Hospitalization in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit | The Iron Status of Very Low Birth Weight Infants Receiving Multiple Erythrocyte Transfusions during Hospitalization in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,"Purpose: We investigated the iron status of very low birth weight infants receiving multiple erythrocyte transfusions during hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Methods: We enrolled 46 very low birth weight infants who were admitted to the Kyungpook National University Hospital between January 2012 and December 2013. Serum ferritin was measured on their first day of life and weekly thereafter. We collected individual data of the frequency and volume of erythrocyte transfusion and the amount of iron intake.Results: A total of 38 (82.6%) of very low birth weight infants received a mean volume of 99.3±93.5 mL of erythrocyte transfusions in NICU. The minimum and maximum serum ferritin levels during hospitalization were 146.2±114.9ng/mL and 456.7±361.9 ng/mL, respectively. The total volume of erythrocyte transfusion was not correlated to max-imum serum ferritin concentrations after controlling for the amount of iron intake (r=0.012, p=0.945). Non-transfused infants took significantly higher iron intake compared to infants receiving ≥100 mL/kg erythrocyte transfusion (p＜0.001). Minimum and maximum serum ferritin levels of non-transfused infants were higher than those of infants receiving ＜100 mL/kg erythrocyte transfusions (p=0.026 and p=0.022, respectively). Infants with morbidity including broncho-pulmonary dysplasia or retinopathy of prematurity received a significantly higher volume of erythrocyte transfusions compared to infants without morbidity (p＜0.001).Conclusion: Very low birth weight infants undergoing multiply erythrocyte transfusions had excessive iron stores and non-transfused infants also might had a risk of iron overload during hospitalization in the NICU.

Differences in Clinical and Laboratory Findings between GroupD and Non-Group D Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Gastroenteritisin Children | Differences in Clinical and Laboratory Findings between GroupD and Non-Group D Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Gastroenteritisin Children,"Purpose: To investigate the differences in clinical features and laboratory findings between group D and non-group D non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) gastroenteritis in children. Methods: A retrospective chart review of children diagnosed with NTS confirmed by culture study was performed. The clinical features and laboratory findings of group D and non-group D NTS were compared. Results: From 2003 to 2012, 75 cases were diagnosed as NTS at our center. The number of group D and non-group D patients was 45 and 30, respectively. The mean age was higher in group D than in non-group D patients (5.1 years vs. 3.4 years, p=0.038). Headaches were more frequently observed (p=0.046) and hematochezia was less frequently observed (p=0.017) in group D than in non-group D NTS gastroenteritis patients. A positive Widal test result was observed in 53.3% of group D and 6.7% of non-group D NTS cases (O-titer, p=0.030; H-titer, p=0.039). There were no differences in white blood cell counts, level of C-reactive protein and rate of antimicrobial resistance between group D and non-group D cases. Conclusion: The more severe clinical features such as headache, fever, and higher Widal titers were found to be indicative of group D NTS gastroenteritis. Additionally, group D NTS gastroenteritis was more commonly found in older patients. Therefore, old age, fever, headache, and a positive Widal test are more indicative of group D NTS than non-group D NTS gastroenteritis. Pathophysiological mechanisms may differ across serologic groups.

Benefits of a Dedicated Breastfeeding Facility and Support Program for Exclusive Breastfeeding among Workers in Indonesia | Benefits of a Dedicated Breastfeeding Facility and Support Program for Exclusive Breastfeeding among Workers in Indonesia,"Purpose: A mother’s working environment is believed to be a major determinant of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) practice. We aimed to define the influence of a facility dedicated to breastfeeding and a breastfeeding support program at the workplace on breastfeeding practice. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in five workplaces. The inclusion criteria were female workers whose last child was between 6 and 36 months old. Observational data were obtained and a questionnaire was filled out. The World Health Organization definition for EBF was used. Results: Data from 186 subjects (74 office workers and 112 factory workers) were collected. Just over half (52%) of the mothers were between 20 and 46 years old, 75.3% had graduated from high school and university, 12.9% had more than two children and 36.0% owned a house. The prevalence of EBF during the last 6 months was 32.3%. A proper dedicated breastfeeding facility was available for 21.5% of the mothers, but only 7.5% had been in contact with a breastfeeding support program. The presence of a dedicated breastfeeding facility increased EBF practice almost threefold, by an odds ratio (OR) of 2.74 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.34-5.64 (p＜0.05). Knowledge of the breastfeeding support program increased EBF practice by almost six times (OR, 5.93; 95% CI, 1.78-19.79) (p＜0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Governments should make it obligatory for employers to offer a breastfeeding support program and a dedicated breastfeeding facility at the workplace as these simple measures significantly in-crease EBF.

Pediatric Cholecystectomy: Clinical Significance of Cases Unrelated to Hematologic Disorders | Pediatric Cholecystectomy: Clinical Significance of Cases Unrelated to Hematologic Disorders,"Purpose: Cholecystectomy is rarely performed in the child and adolescent. However, it is associated with several conditions. This study was conducted to describe the characteristics of pediatric patient who underwent chol-ecystectomy unrelated to hematologic disorders, and then to suggest its clinical significance in management by com-paring a simple and complicated gallbladder disease. Methods: We reviewed cases of cholecystectomy in pediatric patients (under 18 years old) at a single institution between January 2003 and October 2014. There were 143 cases during the study period and 24 were selected as the subject group.Results: There were 7 male (29.2%) and 17 female (70.8%) patients. The mean age was 13.1 years old, and 66.6% of patients were older than 12 years. Mean body weight was 52.7 kg, and body mass index was 21.7 kg/m2, with 41.7% of patients being overweight or obese. We could identify a female predominance and high proportion of over-weight or obesity in a complicated disease. There were also significantly increased levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin in this group. Most patients (87.5%) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Conclusion: Cholecystectomy for diseases unrelated to hematologic disorders is rarely performed in the child and adolescent. In general, female patients who are overweight or obese, and those older than 12 years old, require laparoscopic cholecystectomy owing to multiple gallstones. This condition has a tendency to show a complicated gallbladder disease and significantly increased levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin.
